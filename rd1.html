                        <h5 style="color: white;">On 4 April 2017, Sir Tim was awarded the ACM A.M. Turing Prize for inventing the World Wide
                            Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to
                            scale. The Turing Prize, called the <b style="color: rgb(144, 245, 242);"> "Nobel Prize of
                                Computing"</b> is considered one of
                            the most
                            prestigious awards in Computer Science.The inventor of the World Wide Web and one of Time
                            Magazine's '100 Most Important People of the 20th Century', Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a
                            scientist and academic whose visionary and innovative work has transformed almost every
                            aspect of our lives.Through his selflessness and innovation, Tim Berners-Lee shows he is an
                            hero. Berners-Lee's innovation and selflessness allowed him to create an invention that
                            would revolutionize the world. He is inspiring through his ability to create new things that
                            would be used for the greater good of humankind.</h5>

                                <h5 style="color: white;">The first thing we did was start a Web server at CERN for the phone book. It
                                    [previously] ran on a mainframe, which was a pain to have to log in to, and a lot of
                                    people just logged on to the mainframe to look up peoples phone numbers. The phone
                                    book got a few people to install a Web browser. It spread outside CERN in
                                    high-energy physics, and then ended up taking off exponentially.

                                    1989
                                    Writes a proposal for a “distributed hypertext system.”

                                    1991
                                    The first website goes online.

                                    1994
                                    Founds World Wide Web Consortium for Web standards.

                                    2001
                                    Calls for development of a Semantic Web readable by computers.

                                    2009
                                    Founds World Wide Web Foundation to widen Web access.

                                    The Web now feels indispensable, and is part of many people’s daily personal and
                                    professional life. What still needs working on?

                                    Now we have to talk about it as a human right. It’s not as basic as water, but the
                                    difference in economic and social power between someone who has it and someone who
                                    doesn’t means they’re massively disadvantaged. If you're in a village in Africa and
                                    you don't have access because you can't afford it, or you do have access and you
                                    can't use it because you're not literate, then this is a problem.

                                    When we started the World Wide Web foundation [in 2009] we started pointing out that
                                    if 20 percent of the world has it, they owe the other 80 percent to try and get them
                                    connected as quickly as possible. [The UN said last November that 47 percent of the
                                    world’s population is now online.]

                                    Looking ahead, you have spoken about the need for the Web to be “re-decentralized.”
                                    And you’re part of a community working on technology intended to do that. What’s the
                                    thinking behind this movement?

                                    In the late ‘90s there was a massive excitement about what an incredibly empowering
                                    system this is, and de-centralization was an important part of that. Without asking
                                    anybody else, I could get a computer, put some software on it, plug it into the
                                    Internet, and I’d have a blog and a voice. People thought those voices would mount
                                    up and provide really exciting things. We have got great things like Wikipedia and
                                    crowdfunding, but a lot of people spend all their time in social network silos. A
                                    social network is disempowering because you put a lot of energy into it, all your
                                    personal data out there, and tell it who your friends are. You can only use that
                                    information inside the silo of that particular social network.

                                    We had a few workshops, and we've got people working in the lab on things like Solid
                                    project at MIT, which is saying we could go to a world where everybody is in charge
                                    of their own data. Imagine if all the applications that you run point at data you
                                    control. That is an exciting new mode of operating.</h5>
